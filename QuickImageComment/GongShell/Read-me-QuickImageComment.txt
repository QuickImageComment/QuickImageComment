Revision 93

For usage in QuickImageComment, not needed source files have been removed.
Not needed source code blocks are commented with //QIC.

Some classes and enums have been changed to public, so that in solution QuickImageComment an adapted class ShellTreeView can be implemented.
ShellItem.cs contains additional code with "#if PERFORMANCETEST" for performancetest.

ShellItem.cs contains additional code to override int GetHashCode() - avoids Compiler warning
